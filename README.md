# Private Events

## Overview

Project for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/) as part of the Advanced Forms and Active Record section of the Ruby on Rails course.

Through this project we were tasked with building a website similar to [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/), which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users are able to create events and attend many events, while events may be attended by any number of users.
