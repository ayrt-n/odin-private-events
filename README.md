# Private Events

## Overview

Project for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/) as part of the Advanced Forms and Active Record section of the Ruby on Rails course.

Through this project we were tasked with building a website similar to [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/), which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users are able to create events and attend many events, while events may be attended by any number of users.

The project helped to cement a number of methods on active record associations (working through several different associations, i.e., events belong to hosts (users) but also have many guests (other users). Additionally, through the project we started working with active record queries and scopes. E.g., Active record queries/scopes were used in the private event application to split the presentation of events which have already occurred and are upcoming.
